Look, I’m trying to make WAN2.2 inference scream on NVIDIA’s B200s (sm_100), a lot of it will be transferable to sm_120 i.e. 5090 or 6000 PRO but not all of it. This repo is raw, messy, and full of experiments to max out MFU, memory usage, and cut latency to whatever I can, you can find some graphs, profiles and such below and on my X (<a>https://x.com/Shauray7</a>). If it’s done, it’s in the repo or posted. If it’s planned, it’s below !
<br><br>
My plan is to approch everything, atleast try to optimize everything (a lot of it fails but you can find some of that as well throughout the repo)
